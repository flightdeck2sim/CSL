# CSL
CSLs for flightdeck2sim liveries

## Instructions

Download and unzip the latest release from [releases/latest](https://github.com/flightdeck2sim/CSL/releases/latest); then move the `ALPACA` folder into the X-Plane following the instructions on the [xPilot docs](https://docs.xpilot-project.org/#/user-guide?id=csl-model-configuration).

My preference is to put them in a CSL folder at the X-Plane root, alongside Bluebell CSL and configure the xPilot client to have both. Also note that the paths configured in the xPilot plugin can be relative to the XP root:
