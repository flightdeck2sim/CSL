## Instructions

Download and unzip the latest release from [releases/latest](https://github.com/flightdeck2sim/CSL/releases/latest); then move the `ALPACA` folder into the X-Plane following the instructions on the [xPilot docs](https://xpilot.clowd.io/docs#csl-models).

My preference is to put them in a CSL folder at the X-Plane root, alongside Bluebell CSL and configure the xPilot client to have both.
